        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A personal favorite of mine, banana bread is super yummy and easy to make ! Got old bananas lying 
            around ? No problem ! Use them to create a sweet and moist bread of the banana variety. Why throw 
            them out when they can be used for something better ! Here's a list of ingredients you'll need:</p>

            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>2 1/3 cups mashed overripe bananas</li>
        </ul>
